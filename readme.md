# HTTP JPEG Fetcher

## Description

This project was created as part of my 'Communication & Visualization' subject to offer a hands-on exploration of the core concepts behind the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol, one of the fundamental building blocks of the World Wide Web. This project aims to demystify the inner workings of HTTP and foster a deeper understanding of how web servers and clients communicate to exchange data.

### Key Features and Objectives:

- **HTTP Request Handling:** This project guides users through the process of crafting and sending HTTP GET requests to remote web servers. Users can input the URL of a JPEG image they wish to retrieve, and the program takes care of constructing and transmitting the request.

- **Data Retrieval:** After establishing a connection to the specified web server, the program retrieves the requested JPEG image, showcasing the essential data exchange mechanisms involved in HTTP transactions.

- **Data Manipulation:** The program showcases basic file manipulation techniques. It stores the downloaded image data in a raw binary format (`file_data_raw.txt`) and concurrently generates a hexadecimal representation of the received data (`http_raw.txt`). This demonstrates how data can be processed and transformed as part of HTTP communication.

- **Educational Focus:** This project is primarily geared towards students interested in learning the foundational principles of HTTP. It provides a practical, hands-on experience that complements theoretical knowledge about the protocol.

- **Platform Compatibility:** The code is designed to work on Linux-based systems, offering a Unix-like environment for users to explore HTTP protocol interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before using this program, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- C/C++ compiler.
- Linux-based operating system.
